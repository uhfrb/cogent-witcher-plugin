\definemonster{bear}{Bears}{}{}
\subsection{Bears}
Large heaps of muscle and fur. Any wounds ordinary weapons can inflict are likely only to make them more irate still.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
4-6 STR, 0-1 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)

\subsection{Wargs}
The larger, stronger, nastier cousins of wolves. It is said they delight in evil and cruelty, though scholars
are dubious on this point. It is generally agreed, however, that wargs tend to lead packs of their lesser kin
instead of banding together themselves.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
1-2 STR, 0-2 REF, 1-2 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)

\subsection{Wolves}
Slender, but strong, and silent until they attack. A single wolf should not pose a great threat to a determined
man\footnote{Or a woman, for that matter} with a sword, but they tend to come in packs.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
0-1 STR, 0-2 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)

\section{Humanoids}
These are the various monsters of human shape prowling the world.

\subsection{Harpies}
Roughly Halfling-sized, feathered creatures, chiefly found in areas with rough cliffs.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
(-1)-0 STR, 1-2 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)

\subsubsection{Abilities}

\printability{fly:humanoid}

\section{Necrophages}
Here are listed the manifold corpse-eaters plagueing the war-torn areas of the North. Whereever there
are corpses unburied, one can be sure to come across a handful of these truly unsanitory creatures.

\subsection{Rotfiends}
Of humaniod shape, but with pale, sickly yellow-ish skin and thick, protruding, deeply red veins. Like
with most necrophages, their stench proceeds them. When terminally wounded, they are prone to explode
spectacularily. This is their true danger, since their blood is poisonous.

Injuries dealt by non-silver weapons are halved.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
0-1 STR, 0-1 REF, 0-1 Strangle (proficiency)

\subsubsection{Abilities}

\printability{selfdetonation:rotfiend}

\section{Spectres}\label{monster:spectre}
This section contains all those incorporeal beings whose origins can be found in the deceased. They cannot be
harmed unless by silver weapons or specialized magic. The weaker ones can be dispelled by silver, but those
with uncut ties to the world of the living may simply reappear the next day if defeated.

\subsection{Noonwraiths}
Usually the restless souls of those who came to a violent end in the fields by day. They scorch the earth around them
and can become quite dazzlingly bright. Since they are scolding hot, every turn in close combat results in a minor injury.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
1-2 REF, 0-1 STR, 1-2 Wraith's wrath (proficiency, used in ability-rolls)

\subsubsection{Abilities}

\printability{blinding}
\printability{restoration:spectre}

\subsection{Nightwraiths}
Usually the restless souls of those who came to a violent end in the fields by night. They freeze the grass around them
and can emit fearsomely frosty fog. Since they are deadly cold, every turn in close combat results in a minor injury.

\subparagraph{Stats:}
1-2 REF, 0-1 STR, 1-2 Wraith's wrath (proficiency, used in ability-rolls)

\subsubsection{Abilities}

\printability{freezingfog}
\printability{restoration:spectre}
