\definemonster{bear}{Bears}
{
    Large heaps of muscle and fur. Any wounds ordinary weapons can inflict are likely only to make them more irate still.
}
{
    4-6 STR, 0-1 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)
}

\definemonster{warg}{Wargs}
{
    The larger, stronger, nastier cousins of wolves. It is said they delight in evil and cruelty, though scholars
    are dubious on this point. It is generally agreed, however, that wargs tend to lead packs of their lesser kin
    instead of banding together themselves.
}{
    1-2 STR, 0-2 REF, 1-2 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)
}

\definemonster{wolf}{Wolves}
{
    Slender, but strong, and silent until they attack. A single wolf should not pose a great threat to a determined
    man\footnote{Or a woman, for that matter} with a sword, but they tend to come in packs.
}{
    0-1 STR, 0-2 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)
}

\definemonster{harpy}{Harpies}
{
    Roughly Halfling-sized, feathered creatures, chiefly found in areas with rough cliffs.
}{
    (-1)-0 STR, 1-2 REF, 0-1 Claw'n'Maw (proficiency)
}

\linkability{harpy}{fly:humanoid}

\definemonster{rotfiend}{Rotfiends}
{
    Of humaniod shape, but with pale, sickly yellow-ish skin and thick, protruding, deeply red veins. Like
    with most necrophages, their stench proceeds them. When terminally wounded, they are prone to explode
    spectacularily. This is their true danger, since their blood is poisonous.

    The levels of severity of injuries dealt by non-silver weapons are halved.
}{
    0-1 STR, 0-1 REF, 0-1 Strangle (proficiency)
}

\linkability{rotfiend}{selfdetonation:rotfiend}

\definemonster{noonwraith}{Noonwraiths}
{
    Usually the restless souls of those who came to a violent end in the fields by day. They scorch the earth around them
    and can become quite dazzlingly bright. Since they are scolding hot, every turn in close combat results in a minor injury.
}{
    1-2 REF, 0-1 STR, 1-2 Wraith's wrath (proficiency, used in ability-rolls)
}

\linkability{noonwraith}{blinding}
\linkability{noonwraith}{restoration:spectre}

\definemonster{nightwraith}{Nightwraiths}
{
    Usually the restless souls of those who came to a violent end in the fields by night. They freeze the grass around them
    and can emit fearsomely frosty fog. Since they are deadly cold, every turn in close combat results in a minor injury.
}{
    1-2 REF, 0-1 STR, 1-2 Wraith's wrath (proficiency, used in ability-rolls)
}
